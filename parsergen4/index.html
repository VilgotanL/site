            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                This is a parser generator for JavaScript
            </p>
            <h2>Syntax</h2>
            <p>
                The grammar is comprised of definitions / production rules in the form<br />
                <code>name = expression</code><br />
                Names can only include alphanumeric characters (uppercase, lowercase, and digits) and <code>_</code>, and they cannot start with a digit<br />
                The starting production rule is by default <code>main</code>, but the generated parser can be called with a specific starting production rule to allow parsing from any production rule.<br />
                Important: whitespace is not treated differently to any other characters in parser gen 4.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
                An expression can yield/emit values that will be part of the result of using the generated parser. Expressions can also yield nothing, or discard the yield from a sub-expression.<br />
                An expression can chooose to not consume the input to the parser, leaving it to be consumed by another expression. The expression can still yield things or not yield anything.<br />
                The output of the generated parser is an array-like object containing a list of yielded values.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
                These are the expression types, not ordered in any particular order:

            <h3>Named values</h3>
            <p>
                A named value is a grouped yield (list of values) with a name. In the parser's output it is an array-like object with the list of values.<br />
                If you access a property on the named value, it returns all the named-values inside it with that name with concatenated together into one such named value, of course with yields concatenated.<br />
                Named values in the output also have a .emitted property to get the emitted js strings joined together, and a .text property in case you want the consumed input text of the named value<br />
                The return value of the generated parser functions the same as a named value.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
                An relatively simple example:<br />
                Grammar:<br />
                <code>
                    whitespace = { " " | "\t" | "\r" | "\n" } # Optional whitespace<br />
                    _ = whitespace # An alias for whitespace that I like to use<br />
                    integer = ["-" `-`] {%0-9}+ # Here we emit the digits as javascript strings by using %, you can also use backquote strings as showed for the - sign.<br />
                    identifier = !0-9 {( A-Z | a-z | 0-9 | "_" )}+ # Here I show that you can do it a different and easier way, just use the .text property instead in javascript, and you dont have to emit stuff in grammar<br />
                    <br />
                    main = _ "{" _ Assignments({ assignment _ }) _ "}" _<br />
                    assignment = Assignment( Key(identifier) _ "=" _ Value(expression) )<br />
                    <br />
                    expression<br />
                        = Identifier(identifier)<br />
                        | Integer(integer)<br />
                </code><br />
                I have made the named values start with an uppercase letter to make it easier to read, but they can even have the same name as production rules.<br />
                Test input:<br />
                <code>
                    {
                    my_thing = hello<br />
                    a = b c = d}
                </code><br />
                JavaScript usage after generating the parser:<br />
                <code>
                    const input_text = `<br />
                    {<br />
                    my_thing = hello<br />
                    a = b c = d}<br />
                    `;<br />
                    const ast = parse(input_text);<br />
                    for(let assignment of ast.Assignments) {<br />
                        if(assignment.Value.Integer) console.log(assignment.Key.emitted, "=", assignment.Value.Integer.emitted); // Here i use .emitted<br />
                        else if(assignment.Value.Identifier) console.log(assignment.Key.emitted, "=", assignment.Value.Identifier.text); // Here i use .text instead to show the difference, it is easier because you don't need to emit/yield strings in the grammar<br />
                        else throw new Error("Should not happen");<br />
                    }
                </code>
